Patchbay is a websockets-based API backend for our React & Redux-based [webapp](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp). Patchbay carries React _actions_ onto the server, allowing duplexed communication between webapp clients & the React server. The server is able to fire native React actions that Redux will handle. We use this for reporting the progress of backend services like the completion of [task_mgmt tasks](https://github.com/datatogether/task_mgmt) via a [Redis](https://redis.io) pub-sub connection, leave open the option for cross-user interactions using patchbay as the coordinating server.

We structure this entire websocket integration as a protocol upgrade above the [api service](https://github.com/datatogether/api). From the webapp perspective, it should be possible to have patchbay explode in a glorious ball of fire, and fall back to using api endpoints without interruption to the user.

## Getting Involved

We would love involvement from more people! If you notice any errors or would like 
to submit changes, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). 

We use GitHub issues for [tracking bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/datatogether/patchbay/issues) 
and Pull Requests (PRs) for [submitting changes](https://github.com/datatogether/patchbay/pulls).

## Usage 

Because patchbay supports actions defined in [webapp](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp), the two repos are tightly coupled. The best way to see & work with patchbay is to run it as a backing service for webapp. 

## Development

Webapp's [development instructions](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp/#development) are a great way to get started!
